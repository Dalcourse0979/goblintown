# goblintown
This is a test repository for @Dalcourse0979 to learn GitHub better, and to store a web based story called goblin town.

- the content for goblin town is generated by @Dalcourse0979's kids having sleepy bedtime stories
- while the prose is questionable, it should be kept as close to what the kids say
- a boring w3schools based css library is used
- the entire visible site will just be index.html... for now.
